# Smart-Car
PROJECT: “Smart Car:” We created a model for a smart self-driving car that follows a straight 
lane black colored, We used line track sensor to detect that the car goes out of the lane, in this case 7 
segment is used to display a warning message “ALERT”, We also used IR sensor to detect if there is an 
obstacle in front of the car, in this case the motor of the car should stop.
